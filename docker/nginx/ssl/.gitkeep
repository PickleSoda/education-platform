# SSL Certificate Placeholder

Place your SSL certificates here for HTTPS configuration:

- `cert.pem` - Your SSL certificate
- `key.pem` - Your private key

For development, you can generate self-signed certificates:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout docker/nginx/ssl/key.pem \
  -out docker/nginx/ssl/cert.pem \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"
```

For production, use Let's Encrypt or your certificate provider.
